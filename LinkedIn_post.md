I just published a compact **Big Data** portfolio project using **PySpark** ðŸš€

**What I built**
â€¢ Data cleaning with median imputation (zeros treated as missing)  
â€¢ EDA & visualisations (histogram, boxplot, scatter)  
â€¢ **Spark SQL** query over the cleaned DataFrame  
â€¢ **MLlib** models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression  
â€¢ Reproducible structure with saved figures and metrics

**Why it matters**
It demonstrates practical Spark skills endâ€‘toâ€‘end â€” not only modelling, but also data quality, feature prep, evaluation, and documentation.

Repo highlights: scripts for each step (`src/01_data_prep.py`, `02_eda_sql.py`, `03_models.py`), outputs to check results fast, and a short report.

Happy to get feedback! #bigdata #spark #pyspark #datascience #machinelearning
